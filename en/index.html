                <blockquote>“Kanstantsin demonstrated the depth of his linguistic prowess by developing a language verification test (Belarusian) and providing insightful feedback to improve the quality of our Belarusian database. He later took on a manager role for our Belarusian translation team, hiring and managing a remote global team of translators. Finally, he has been a valuable asset to the company as a Russian and Ukrainian Translator, contributing to projects that require high quality translations on tight deadlines. Kanstantsin is highly recommended by myself and our company as a linguist and colleague.”</blockquote>
